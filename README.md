### **Week 4: Competitive & SWOT Analysis**

**Objective:** Improve market awareness and strategic thinking. Compare two Chat LLM products, example ChatGPT vs Claud, Copilot vs Glean, Gemini vs Perplexity, or any cross combination. Remember to study the enterprise or paid version (don't actually buy or pay for it).

**Assignment:**

* Conduct a **competitive analysis** between your chosen product and one direct competitor (2 companies total):
  * Use both products directly if possible. Take and include screenshots of key features, user flows, and any notable differences you observe.
  * Create a detailed feature comparison table highlighting similarities and differences.
  * Clearly identify and discuss the key market differentiators between the two products.
  * Summarize the main strengths and weaknesses of each product, focusing on what sets them apart in the market.
* Create a **SWOT analysis** for your chosen product, using your hands-on experience and research.
* Be sure to highlight how the user experience, feature set, and market positioning differ between the two companies.
  
**Note:** If you cannot access the products directly, use publicly available screenshots, demo videos, or user reviews to illustrate your findings.

**Assignment Expectation:**  
Participants are expected to gain firsthand experience with the products being analyzed. Ideally, this means directly using (dogfooding) the product to understand its capabilities and user experience. If direct access is not possible (e.g., due to paywalls or enterprise restrictions), participants should creatively leverage alternative resources—such as public documentation, user-written blogs, YouTube demos, published case studies, or any other publicly available materials—to inform their competitive analysis. The goal is to demonstrate resourcefulness and a thorough, well-reasoned comparison, even when direct product access is limited.
